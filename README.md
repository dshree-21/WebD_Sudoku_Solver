# WebD_Sudoku_Solver


Welcome to this Sudoku game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This game is based on the concepts of data structures and algorithms. This readme file will provide you with all the necessary information to play the game, understand its functionality, and the algorithms used to solve it.

How to Play?

The Sudoku game consists of a 9x9 grid, divided into nine 3x3 sub-grids. 

The objective of the game is to fill in each cell of the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, in such a way that each row, column, and sub-grid contains all the digits from 1 to 9, without repetition.

To play the game, click on an empty cell and select a number from the numbers panel located on the right side of the screen. If the selected number is valid, it will be added to the cell. If the number is not valid, an error message will be displayed, and the cell will remain empty. You can undo your moves using the 'Undo' button located on the left side of the screen.

To win the game, you must fill in all the cells with valid numbers, following the rules of the game.
